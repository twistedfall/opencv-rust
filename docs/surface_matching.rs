	//! Introduction to Surface Matching
	//! --------------------------------
	//! 
	//! Cameras and similar devices with the capability of sensation of 3D structure are becoming more
	//! common. Thus, using depth and intensity information for matching 3D objects (or parts) are of
	//! crucial importance for computer vision. Applications range from industrial control to guiding
	//! everyday actions for visually impaired people. The task in recognition and pose estimation in range
	//! images aims to identify and localize a queried 3D free-form object by matching it to the acquired
	//! database.
	//! 
	//! From an industrial perspective, enabling robots to automatically locate and pick up randomly placed
	//! and oriented objects from a bin is an important challenge in factory automation, replacing tedious
	//! and heavy manual labor. A system should be able to recognize and locate objects with a predefined
	//! shape and estimate the position with the precision necessary for a gripping robot to pick it up.
	//! This is where vision guided robotics takes the stage. Similar tools are also capable of guiding
	//! robots (and even people) through unstructured environments, leading to automated navigation. These
	//! properties make 3D matching from point clouds a ubiquitous necessity. Within this context, I will
	//! now describe the OpenCV implementation of a 3D object recognition and pose estimation algorithm
	//! using 3D features.
	//! 
	//! Surface Matching Algorithm Through 3D Features
	//! ----------------------------------------------
	//! 
	//! The state of the algorithms in order to achieve the task 3D matching is heavily based on
	//! [drost2010](https://docs.opencv.org/4.8.1/d0/de3/citelist.html#CITEREF_drost2010), which is one of the first and main practical methods presented in this area. The
	//! approach is composed of extracting 3D feature points randomly from depth images or generic point
	//! clouds, indexing them and later in runtime querying them efficiently. Only the 3D structure is
	//! considered, and a trivial hash table is used for feature queries.
	//! 
	//! While being fully aware that utilization of the nice CAD model structure in order to achieve a smart
	//! point sampling, I will be leaving that aside now in order to respect the generalizability of the
	//! methods (Typically for such algorithms training on a CAD model is not needed, and a point cloud
	//! would be sufficient). Below is the outline of the entire algorithm:
	//! 
	//! ![Outline of the Algorithm](https://docs.opencv.org/4.8.1/outline.jpg)
	//! 
	//! As explained, the algorithm relies on the extraction and indexing of point pair features, which are
	//! defined as follows:
	//! 
	//! ![block formula](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbf%7B%7BF%7D%7D%28%5Cbf%7B%7Bm1%7D%7D%2C%20%5Cbf%7B%7Bm2%7D%7D%29%20%3D%20%28%7C%7C%5Cbf%7B%7Bd%7D%7D%7C%7C%5F2%2C%20%3C%28%5Cbf%7B%7Bn1%7D%7D%2C%5Cbf%7B%7Bd%7D%7D%29%2C%20%3C%28%5Cbf%7B%7Bn2%7D%7D%2C%5Cbf%7B%7Bd%7D%7D%29%2C%20%3C%28%5Cbf%7B%7Bn1%7D%7D%2C%5Cbf%7B%7Bn2%7D%7D%29%29)
	//! 
	//! where ![inline formula](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbf%7B%7Bm1%7D%7D) and ![inline formula](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbf%7B%7Bm2%7D%7D) are feature two selected points on the model (or scene),
	//! ![inline formula](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbf%7B%7Bd%7D%7D) is the difference vector, ![inline formula](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbf%7B%7Bn1%7D%7D) and ![inline formula](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbf%7B%7Bn2%7D%7D) are the normals at ![inline formula](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbf%7B%7Bm1%7D%7D) and
	//! ![inline formula](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbf%7Bm2%7D). During the training stage, this vector is quantized, indexed. In the test stage, same
	//! features are extracted from the scene and compared to the database. With a few tricks like
	//! separation of the rotational components, the pose estimation part can also be made efficient (check
	//! the reference for more details). A Hough-like voting and clustering is employed to estimate the
	//! object pose. To cluster the poses, the raw pose hypotheses are sorted in decreasing order of the
	//! number of votes. From the highest vote, a new cluster is created. If the next pose hypothesis is
	//! close to one of the existing clusters, the hypothesis is added to the cluster and the cluster center
	//! is updated as the average of the pose hypotheses within the cluster. If the next hypothesis is not
	//! close to any of the clusters, it creates a new cluster. The proximity testing is done with fixed
	//! thresholds in translation and rotation. Distance computation and averaging for translation are
	//! performed in the 3D Euclidean space, while those for rotation are performed using quaternion
	//! representation. After clustering, the clusters are sorted in decreasing order of the total number of
	//! votes which determines confidence of the estimated poses.
	//! 
	//! This pose is further refined using ![inline formula](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?ICP) in order to obtain the final pose.
	//! 
	//! PPF presented above depends largely on robust computation of angles between 3D vectors. Even though
	//! not reported in the paper, the naive way of doing this (![inline formula](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctheta%20%3D%20cos%5E%7B%2D1%7D%28%7B%5Cbf%7Ba%7D%7D%5Ccdot%7B%5Cbf%7Bb%7D%7D%29)
	//! remains numerically unstable. A better way to do this is then use inverse tangents, like:
	//!

	//! 
	//! ### Hough-like Voting Scheme
	//! 
	//! As shown in the outline, PPF (point pair features) are extracted from the model, quantized, stored
	//! in the hashtable and indexed, during the training stage. During the runtime however, the similar
	//! operation is perfomed on the input scene with the exception that this time a similarity lookup over
	//! the hashtable is performed, instead of an insertion. This lookup also allows us to compute a
	//! transformation to the ground plane for the scene pairs. After this point, computing the rotational
	//! component of the pose reduces to computation of the difference ![inline formula](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Calpha%3D%5Calpha%5Fm%2D%5Calpha%5Fs). This
	//! component carries the cue about the object pose. A Hough-like voting scheme is performed over the
	//! local model coordinate vector and ![inline formula](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Calpha). The highest poses achieved for every scene point lets us
	//! recover the object pose.
	//! 
	//! ### Source Code for PPF Matching
	//! 
	//! ~~~{cpp}
	//! // pc is the loaded point cloud of the model
	//! // (Nx6) and pcTest is a loaded point cloud of
	//! // the scene (Mx6)
	//! ppf_match_3d::PPF3DDetector detector(0.03, 0.05);
	//! detector.trainModel(pc);
	//! vector<Pose3DPtr> results;
	//! detector.match(pcTest, results, 1.0/10.0, 0.05);
	//! cout << "Poses: " << endl;
	//! // print the poses
	//! for (size_t i=0; i<results.size(); i++)
	//! {
	//!    Pose3DPtr pose = results[i];
	//!    cout << "Pose Result " << i << endl;
	//!    pose->printPose();
	//! }
	//! ~~~
	//! 
	//! Pose Registration via ICP
	//! -------------------------
	//! 
	//! The matching process terminates with the attainment of the pose. However, due to the multiple
	//! matching points, erroneous hypothesis, pose averaging and etc. such pose is very open to noise and
	//! many times is far from being perfect. Although the visual results obtained in that stage are
	//! pleasing, the quantitative evaluation shows ![inline formula](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%7E10) degrees variation (error), which is an acceptable
	//! level of matching. Many times, the requirement might be set well beyond this margin and it is
	//! desired to refine the computed pose.
	//! 
	//! Furthermore, in typical RGBD scenes and point clouds, 3D structure can capture only less than half
	//! of the model due to the visibility in the scene. Therefore, a robust pose refinement algorithm,
	//! which can register occluded and partially visible shapes quickly and correctly is not an unrealistic
	//! wish.
	//! 
	//! At this point, a trivial option would be to use the well known iterative closest point algorithm .
	//! However, utilization of the basic ICP leads to slow convergence, bad registration, outlier
	//! sensitivity and failure to register partial shapes. Thus, it is definitely not suited to the
	//! problem. For this reason, many variants have been proposed . Different variants contribute to
	//! different stages of the pose estimation process.
	//! 
	//! ICP is composed of ![inline formula](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?6) stages and the improvements I propose for each stage is summarized below.
	//! 
	//! ### Sampling
	//! 
	//! To improve convergence speed and computation time, it is common to use less points than the model
	//! actually has. However, sampling the correct points to register is an issue in itself. The naive way
	//! would be to sample uniformly and hope to get a reasonable subset. More smarter ways try to identify
	//! the critical points, which are found to highly contribute to the registration process. Gelfand et.
	//! al. exploit the covariance matrix in order to constrain the eigenspace, so that a set of points
	//! which affect both translation and rotation are used. This is a clever way of subsampling, which I
	//! will optionally be using in the implementation.
	//! 
	//! ### Correspondence Search
	//! 
	//! As the name implies, this step is actually the assignment of the points in the data and the model in
	//! a closest point fashion. Correct assignments will lead to a correct pose, where wrong assignments
	//! strongly degrade the result. In general, KD-trees are used in the search of nearest neighbors, to
	//! increase the speed. However this is not an optimality guarantee and many times causes wrong points
	//! to be matched. Luckily the assignments are corrected over iterations.
	//! 
	//! To overcome some of the limitations, Picky ICP [pickyicp](https://docs.opencv.org/4.8.1/d0/de3/citelist.html#CITEREF_pickyicp) and BC-ICP (ICP using bi-unique
	//! correspondences) are two well-known methods. Picky ICP first finds the correspondences in the
	//! old-fashioned way and then among the resulting corresponding pairs, if more than one scene point
	//! ![inline formula](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p%5Fi) is assigned to the same model point ![inline formula](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?m%5Fj), it selects ![inline formula](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p%5Fi) that corresponds to the minimum
	//! distance. BC-ICP on the other hand, allows multiple correspondences first and then resolves the
	//! assignments by establishing bi-unique correspondences. It also defines a novel no-correspondence
	//! outlier, which intrinsically eases the process of identifying outliers.
	//! 
	//! For reference, both methods are used. Because P-ICP is a bit faster, with not-so-significant
	//! performance drawback, it will be the method of choice in refinment of correspondences.
	//! 
	//! ### Weighting of Pairs
	//! 
	//! In my implementation, I currently do not use a weighting scheme. But the common approaches involve
	//! *normal compatibility* (![inline formula](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?w%5Fi%3Dn%5E1%5Fi%5Ccdot%20n%5E2%5Fj)) or assigning lower weights to point pairs with
	//! greater distances (![inline formula](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?w%3D1%2D%5Cfrac%7B%7C%7Cdist%28m%5Fi%2Cs%5Fi%29%7C%7C%5F2%7D%7Bdist%5F%7Bmax%7D%7D)).
	//! 
	//! ### Rejection of Pairs
	//! 
	//! The rejections are done using a dynamic thresholding based on a robust estimate of the standard
	//! deviation. In other words, in each iteration, I find the MAD estimate of the Std. Dev. I denote this
	//! as ![inline formula](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?mad%5Fi). I reject the pairs with distances ![inline formula](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?d%5Fi%3E%5Ctau%20mad%5Fi). Here ![inline formula](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctau) is the threshold of
	//! rejection and by default set to ![inline formula](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?3). The weighting is applied prior to Picky refinement, explained
	//! in the previous stage.
	//! 
	//! ### Error Metric
	//! 
	//! As described in , a linearization of point to plane as in [koklimlow](https://docs.opencv.org/4.8.1/d0/de3/citelist.html#CITEREF_koklimlow) error metric is used. This
	//! both speeds up the registration process and improves convergence.
	//! 
	//! ### Minimization
	//! 
	//! Even though many non-linear optimizers (such as Levenberg Mardquardt) are proposed, due to the
	//! linearization in the previous step, pose estimation reduces to solving a linear system of equations.
	//! This is what I do exactly using cv::solve with DECOMP_SVD option.
	//! 
	//! ### ICP Algorithm
	//! 
	//! Having described the steps above, here I summarize the layout of the ICP algorithm.
	//! 
	//! #### Efficient ICP Through Point Cloud Pyramids
	//! 
	//! While the up-to-now-proposed variants deal well with some outliers and bad initializations, they
	//! require significant number of iterations. Yet, multi-resolution scheme can help reducing the number
	//! of iterations by allowing the registration to start from a coarse level and propagate to the lower
	//! and finer levels. Such approach both improves the performances and enhances the runtime.
	//! 
	//! The search is done through multiple levels, in a hierarchical fashion. The registration starts with
	//! a very coarse set of samples of the model. Iteratively, the points are densified and sought. After
	//! each iteration the previously estimated pose is used as an initial pose and refined with the ICP.
	//! 
	//! #### Visual Results
	//! 
	//! ##### Results on Synthetic Data
	//! 
	//! In all of the results, the pose is initiated by PPF and the rest is left as:
	//! ![inline formula](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5B%5Ctheta%5Fx%2C%20%5Ctheta%5Fy%2C%20%5Ctheta%5Fz%2C%20t%5Fx%2C%20t%5Fy%2C%20t%5Fz%5D%3D%5B0%5D)
	//! 
	//! ### Source Code for Pose Refinement Using ICP
	//! 
	//! ~~~{cpp}
	//! ICP icp(200, 0.001f, 2.5f, 8);
	//! // Using the previously declared pc and pcTest
	//! // This will perform registration for every pose
	//! // contained in results
	//! icp.registerModelToScene(pc, pcTest, results);
	//! 
	//! // results now contain the refined poses

	//! A Complete Sample
	//! -----------------
	//! 
	//! ### Parameter Tuning
	//! 
	//! Surface matching module treats its parameters relative to the model diameter (diameter of the axis
	//! parallel bounding box), whenever it can. This makes the parameters independent from the model size.
	//! This is why, both model and scene cloud were subsampled such that all points have a minimum distance
	//! of ![inline formula](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?RelativeSamplingStep%2ADimensionRange), where ![inline formula](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?DimensionRange) is the distance along a given
	//! dimension. All three dimensions are sampled in similar manner. For example, if
	//! ![inline formula](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?RelativeSamplingStep) is set to 0.05 and the diameter of model is 1m (1000mm), the points sampled
	//! from the object's surface will be approximately 50 mm apart. From another point of view, if the
	//! sampling RelativeSamplingStep is set to 0.05, at most ![inline formula](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?20x20x20%20%3D%208000) model points are generated
	//! (depending on how the model fills in the volume). Consequently this results in at most 8000x8000
	//! pairs. In practice, because the models are not uniformly distributed over a rectangular prism, much
	//! less points are to be expected. Decreasing this value, results in more model points and thus a more
	//! accurate representation. However, note that number of point pair features to be computed is now
	//! quadratically increased as the complexity is O(N\^2). This is especially a concern for 32 bit
	//! systems, where large models can easily overshoot the available memory. Typically, values in the
	//! range of 0.025 - 0.05 seem adequate for most of the applications, where the default value is 0.03.
	//! (Note that there is a difference in this paremeter with the one presented in [drost2010](https://docs.opencv.org/4.8.1/d0/de3/citelist.html#CITEREF_drost2010) . In
	//! [drost2010](https://docs.opencv.org/4.8.1/d0/de3/citelist.html#CITEREF_drost2010) a uniform cuboid is used for quantization and model diameter is used for reference of
	//! sampling. In my implementation, the cuboid is a rectangular prism, and each dimension is quantized
	//! independently. I do not take reference from the diameter but along the individual dimensions.
	//! 
	//! It would very wise to remove the outliers from the model and prepare an ideal model initially. This
	//! is because, the outliers directly affect the relative computations and degrade the matching
	//! accuracy.
	//! 
	//! During runtime stage, the scene is again sampled by ![inline formula](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?RelativeSamplingStep), as described above.
	//! However this time, only a portion of the scene points are used as reference. This portion is
	//! controlled by the parameter ![inline formula](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?RelativeSceneSampleStep), where
	//! ![inline formula](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?SceneSampleStep%20%3D%20%28int%29%281%2E0%2FRelativeSceneSampleStep%29). In other words, if the
	//! ![inline formula](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?RelativeSceneSampleStep%20%3D%201%2E0%2F5%2E0), the subsampled scene will once again be uniformly sampled to
	//! 1/5 of the number of points. Maximum value of this parameter is 1 and increasing this parameter also
	//! increases the stability, but decreases the speed. Again, because of the initial scene-independent
	//! relative sampling, fine tuning this parameter is not a big concern. This would only be an issue when
	//! the model shape occupies a volume uniformly, or when the model shape is condensed in a tiny place
	//! within the quantization volume (e.g. The octree representation would have too much empty cells).
	//! 
	//! ![inline formula](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?RelativeDistanceStep) acts as a step of discretization over the hash table. The point pair features
	//! are quantized to be mapped to the buckets of the hashtable. This discretization involves a
	//! multiplication and a casting to the integer. Adjusting RelativeDistanceStep in theory controls the
	//! collision rate. Note that, more collisions on the hashtable results in less accurate estimations.
	//! Reducing this parameter increases the affect of quantization but starts to assign non-similar point
	//! pairs to the same bins. Increasing it however, wanes the ability to group the similar pairs.
	//! Generally, because during the sampling stage, the training model points are selected uniformly with
	//! a distance controlled by RelativeSamplingStep, RelativeDistanceStep is expected to equate to this
	//! value. Yet again, values in the range of 0.025-0.05 are sensible. This time however, when the model
	//! is dense, it is not advised to decrease this value. For noisy scenes, the value can be increased to
	//! improve the robustness of the matching against noisy points.
