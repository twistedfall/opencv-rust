/// Loads a of images of a multi-page image from a file.
/// 
/// The function imreadmulti loads a specified range from a multi-page image from the specified file into a vector of Mat objects.
/// ## Parameters
/// * filename: Name of file to be loaded.
/// * start: Start index of the image to load
/// * count: Count number of images to load
/// * flags: Flag that can take values of cv::ImreadModes, default with cv::IMREAD_ANYCOLOR.
/// * mats: A vector of Mat objects holding each page, if more than one.
/// ## See also
/// cv::imread
/// 
/// ## C++ default parameters
/// * flags: IMREAD_ANYCOLOR

/// Saves an image to a specified file.
/// 
/// The function imwrite saves the image to the specified file. The image format is chosen based on the
/// filename extension (see cv::imread for the list of extensions). In general, only 8-bit
/// single-channel or 3-channel (with 'BGR' channel order) images
/// can be saved using this function, with these exceptions:
/// 
/// - 16-bit unsigned (CV_16U) images can be saved in the case of PNG, JPEG 2000, and TIFF formats
/// - 32-bit float (CV_32F) images can be saved in PFM, TIFF, OpenEXR, and Radiance HDR formats;
///   3-channel (CV_32FC3) TIFF images will be saved using the LogLuv high dynamic range encoding
///   (4 bytes per pixel)
/// - PNG images with an alpha channel can be saved using this function. To do this, create
/// 8-bit (or 16-bit) 4-channel image BGRA, where the alpha channel goes last. Fully transparent pixels
/// should have alpha set to 0, fully opaque pixels should have alpha set to 255/65535 (see the code sample below).
/// - Multiple images (vector of Mat) can be saved in TIFF format (see the code sample below).
/// 
/// If the image format is not supported, the image will be converted to 8-bit unsigned (CV_8U) and saved that way.
/// 
/// If the format, depth or channel order is different, use
/// Mat::convertTo and cv::cvtColor to convert it before saving. Or, use the universal FileStorage I/O
/// functions to save the image to XML or YAML format.
/// 
/// The sample below shows how to create a BGRA image, how to set custom compression parameters and save it to a PNG file.
/// It also demonstrates how to save multiple images in a TIFF file:
/// @include snippets/imgcodecs_imwrite.cpp
/// ## Parameters
/// * filename: Name of the file.
/// * img: (Mat or vector of Mat) Image or Images to be saved.
/// * params: Format-specific parameters encoded as pairs (paramId_1, paramValue_1, paramId_2, paramValue_2, ... .) see cv::ImwriteFlags
/// 
/// ## C++ default parameters
/// * params: std::vector<int>()
